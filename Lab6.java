  To-do: 
  1. Below every single comment line, write the appropriate java code.
  2. Make sure your program is free of errors and runs.
  2. Answer the following questions:
     a. What is the name of this class?                                         Lab6
     b. What is the name of this file?                                          Lab6.java
     c. What is the difference between a class name and a file name?            class name is byte.class and filename.java
     d. What is the difference between importing Scanner and instantiating Scanner?    importing a scanner makes the instantiating scanner work. 
     
   Sample output of running this program:
  
*/
//import Scanner for usage
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Lab6{

  //entry point of app
  public static void main(String[] args){
    
    //instantiate the Scanner object for usage, call it input
  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
      

  }
  
}
